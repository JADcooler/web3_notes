PRIVATE VARIABLE TO PUBLIC VARIABLE
___________________________________

Has a contract from one contract with private variables duplicated in other contract where the private
variables are public and have their compiler issued getters.

maybe a small script that changes keyword "private" to "public" in every line which doesn't start with function

then a function definition that uses assembly perhaps, to store private variables of the target function
in our duplicated function.

assembly 
{
loop
	sstore on slot 0 read from target contract slot 0
			i				i
}

this function can be called __pvCopy()
