everything we send is public.

msg.sender refers to the one who makes the req

we have (hexdigest, value)

this is visible for everyone.

so we have this from user side
 (fake, value, secret) #not sure why this secret shit is used
 visible only to the user

 if the sender just wanted to pump up or make the auction look bimbo he uses fake=1
 then hashes the three and puts it out as (hexdigest, value).

 the auction after ending, makes all em send the original (fake, value, secret) as array
 then the array of (hexdigest, value) in contract is compared

 compute hash and check if legit
 i.e hash(fake[i] + value[i] + secret[i]) == hexdigest[i] 
 
 if fake == 0 and bitch is not highest bidder we refund
 if fake == 1 we ignore
 if hash doesn't match. we ignore
