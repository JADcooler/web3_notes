lets say

library asd
{

function qwe(uint)
{


}
}

using asd for uint16;

uint16 x;
x.qwe(2) //works because uint16 is implicitly convertible to uint

Solidity compiler allows implicit conversion between two data 
types provided 
no implicit conversion is possible 
and there is no loss of information. For example uint8 is convertible
 to uint16 
but int8 is convertible to uint256 as int8 can contain negative
 value not allowed in uint256.
