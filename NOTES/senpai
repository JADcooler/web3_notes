how does self destruct force send money ?
can regular transacions somehow do that?
maybe without the selfdestruct bytecode?



------------------------------------------------------------
utxo model makes use of unspent transactions to prove money
how do flashloans fit into that?

if I use the transaction of flashloan to call another contract
using a low level call.
will the transaction be already in the mempool or wont be
created yet till it doesn't revert?

liquidity through flashloans
how does that work?

---------------------------

so, lets say
flasloans is offered by LP
I use same flashloans to offer flash loans
to someone else with higher fee

profit profit?
