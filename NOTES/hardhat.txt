As the warning says, you are making an eth_call in an account with no code. That usually happens when you use two different instances of the hardhat network. For example, if you have a script that deploys the contract and another that uses the contract, and you do hh run deploy.js && hh run useContract.js, each script will create, use and destroy a temporary, in-process hardhat network.

Another typical reason people get this error is when they start a node with hh node in one terminal and run their script in another terminal by doing hh run useContract.js instead of hh run --network localhost useContract.js.

I'm going to close this because it's very unlikely this is a bug. Please use our discord server if you have more questions about this.
