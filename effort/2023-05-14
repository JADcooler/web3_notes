today's plan : 

1) do as much of damn defi

2) foundry


____________________

errors faced:

1) got an error for 
transaction reverted: function returned an unexpected amount
of data.

fix was to check function parameter was same as the 
inherited one and that the state values are initialized.

2) got an error that helpers is not defined, despite 
installing and including it.

solution was to use time.increase instead of helpers.time.inc
