Notice that we’re multiplying before converting to integer. Otherwise, we’ll lose precision.

to convert prices ( which are in float ) To Q.64.96


we multiply by 2^96 then convert to int.
if vice versa it loses precision,eg: 4.4 becomes 4 

mint callback requires user to send amount, then checks if he actually
did

del y = shit ur gonna give for del x

uniSWAP core uses callbacks instead of ERCtransferfrom for 
mint and swap

mulmod is a Solidity function that multiplies two numbers (a and b), 
divides the result by denominator, and returns the remainder.
 If the remainder is positive, we round the result up.
