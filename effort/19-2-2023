require vs assert

require refunds gas
assert consumes gas

shheez how ARE these byes stored ? -_-
QUOTE'
There are some operations in Solidity that need a temporary memory area larger than 64 bytes and therefore will not fit into the scratch space. They will be placed where the free memory points to, but given their short lifetime, the pointer is not updated. The memory may or may not be zeroed out. Because of this, one should not expect the free memory to point to zeroed out memory.
UNQUOTE

so, what ARe these operations ? 9_9
