UNISWAP V3 whitepaper
_____________________

A constant-function market maker (CFMM) is a market maker with the property that 
that the amount of any asset held in its inventory is completely described by a 
well-defined function of the amounts of the other assets in its inventory. 
As a result, both wealth and liquidity are known and fixed given relative prices.

prob wit u1,u2 is that only a fraction of assets are available in a given price,
its inefficient.

curve and yield pool can result in liquidity fragmentation


multiple pools for a pair of tokens, each  with different swap fee

UNI governane to change fees

fees are not added to the pool in which its paid as directly
because of positions. (entha position la liquidity ah poduvanga?)
fee earnings are stored separately
and held as the tokens in which the fees are paid 

in v3, the pool contract does not implement the
ERC-20 standard
