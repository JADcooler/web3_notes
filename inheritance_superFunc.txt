so,

If I have,
contract BASE

contract B1 is BASE
contract B2 is BASE 
contract B3 is B1,B2

If I have function func() in all of them
and I call super.func() in B3 it'll go to B2
If I call super.func() in B2, it'll go to B1,
If I call super.func() in B1, only then BASE func() executes

As you can see, There is kind of like a array ish kinda execution

This shit is called inheritance graph

In this case it is, 

B3 -> B2 -> B1 -> BASE
