In a perpetual contract, the profit or loss of one trader is essentially transferred
 from those who are on the losing side. For example, if one trader opens a long 
 position (betting on price increase) and another trader opens a short position 
 (betting on price decrease), the gains of the long position would come from the 
 losses of the short position, and vice versa
