nonce – A counter that indicates the number of transactions sent 
 from an externally-owned account or the number of contracts created by a 
contract account.

EIP-2718(opens in a new tab)↗ is what allows for this behavior. Transactions are interpreted as:

TransactionType || TransactionPayload

Where the fields are defined as:

TransactionType - a number between 0 and 0x7f, for a total of 128 possible transaction types.
TransactionPayload - an arbitrary byte array defined by the transaction type
