function where a mini pool assigns a owner from the multisig,
implementation makes such that same enabled owner is used for all pools. This will DOS the pools
if he deactivates, so make round robin approach (instead of looping from 0, loop from i
where i = previous owner index)

required signatures can be greater than number of owners, making multisig unusable

destination address is not checked to be a contract, it will show as executed in the case its self destructed (trail of bits)
