for an array if iteration is unbounded, gas limit may expire and revert
so add an upperbound - low severity

Check if conditions, some might require revert instead.
eg token convertion recieve but giveback uses if condition, such that if it fails, tx isn't reverted - high severity

use of uninitialized vars affecting calculations - low severity

fee reduced on msg.sender, example transferFrom reduces fee on msg.sender, though he wasnt part of txn. - low severity

arbitrary value assignment cannot be reversed - medium severity
