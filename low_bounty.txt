for an array if iteration is unbounded, gas limit may expire and revert
so add an upperbound - low severity

Check if conditions, some might require revert instead.
eg token convertion recieve but giveback uses if condition, such that if it fails, tx isn't reverted - high severity

use of uninitialized vars affecting calculations - low severity

fee reduced on msg.sender, example transferFrom reduces fee on msg.sender, though he wasnt part of txn. - low severity

arbitrary value assignment cannot be reversed - medium severity

txns in same block diff block giving different effects, maybe uintended - high severity

no checks on roundID nor timeStamp, resulting in stale
price IN ORACLE - medium severity

STUPID - mempool transaction of an user is noted, attacker sees it and issues same txn with higher priority,
	victim gets error because of DOS since similar parameters were passed by attacker - severity ??? --> https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-05-yield-findings/issues/43
